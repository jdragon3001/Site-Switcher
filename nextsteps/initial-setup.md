#### Recent Issues Fixed (Based on User Feedback):
- ❌ **Problem**: Replacements were still too long despite length constraints
- ❌ **Problem**: Elements were being removed instead of properly replaced
- ❌ **Problem**: Only brand names were being replaced, not actual content
- ✅ **Solution**: Complete architecture redesign with semantic analysis first
- ✅ **Solution**: Two-phase approach: analyze page structure, then apply targeted replacements
- ✅ **Solution**: Separate handling for direct replacements vs contextual adaptations
- ✅ **Solution**: Hard length limits with truncation if AI exceeds word count
- ❌ **NEW PROBLEM**: First round of transformations was perfect, but system went back and re-edited everything, messing it up
- ✅ **NEW SOLUTION**: Disabled the "remaining transformations" phase that was causing re-editing
- ✅ **NEW SOLUTION**: Added stronger protection against re-transformation of already processed elements
- ✅ **NEW SOLUTION**: Trust the excellent first-round implementation steps (brand replacement, button handling, section transformations)
- ❌ **NEWEST PROBLEM**: Extension works great on traditional HTML sites but fails on React sites (only transforms 3 buttons, ignores 59 detected elements)
- ✅ **NEWEST SOLUTION**: Added React Site Fallback system that detects when semantic targeting fails
- ✅ **NEWEST SOLUTION**: Flexible brand replacement that uses pattern matching instead of exact text matching for React components
- ✅ **NEWEST SOLUTION**: Direct priority element transformation that bypasses semantic selectors for React sites with dynamic class names
- ❌ **CRITICAL LAYOUT PROBLEM**: React fallback was destroying page layouts by replacing massive container DIVs (500+ chars) with tiny phrases (2-3 words)
- ✅ **CRITICAL LAYOUT SOLUTION**: Added smart element filtering to avoid container elements and target individual text elements only
- ✅ **CRITICAL LAYOUT SOLUTION**: Strict length validation (10-300 chars) and container detection to prevent layout destruction
- ✅ **CRITICAL LAYOUT SOLUTION**: Prioritize semantic HTML elements (H1-H6, P, SPAN, LI) over generic containers (DIV)

### Success Criteria
